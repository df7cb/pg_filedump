------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:

pg_filedump is a utility to format PostgreSQL heap/index/control files
into a human-readable form.  You can format/dump the files several ways,
as listed in the Invocation section, as well as dumping straight binary.

The type of file (heap/index) can usually be determined automatically
by the content of the blocks within the file.  However, to format a
pg_control file you must use the -c option.

The default is to format the entire file using the block size listed in
block 0 and display block relative addresses.  These defaults can be
modified using run-time options.

Some options may seem strange but they're there for a reason.  For
example, block size.  It's there because if the header of block 0 is
corrupt, you need a method of forcing a block size.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile/Installation:

To compile pg_filedump, you will need to have a properly configured
PostgreSQL source tree or complete install tree (with include files)
of the appropriate PostgreSQL major version.

There are two makefiles included in this package.  Makefile is a standalone
makefile for pg_filedump.  Makefile.contrib can be used if this package
was untarred in the contrib directory of a PostgreSQL build tree.

  make
  make install

It is also possible to use Makefile.contrib without being in the contrib
directory:

  make -f Makefile.contrib USE_PGXS=1

Both methods require that the pg_config program be in your PATH, but should
not require any manual adjustments of the Makefile.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Invocation:

pg_filedump [-abcdfhikxy] [-R startblock [endblock]] [-D attrlist] [-S blocksize] [-s segsize] [-n segnumber] file

Defaults are: relative addressing, range of the entire file, block size
              as listed on block 0 in the file

The following options are valid for heap and index files:
  -a  Display absolute addresses when formatting (Block header
      information is always block relative)
  -b  Display binary block images within a range (Option will turn
      off all formatting options)
  -d  Display formatted block content dump (Option will turn off
      all other formatting options)
  -D  Decode tuples using given comma separated list of types.
      List of supported types:
        * bigint
        * bigserial
        * bool
        * char
        * charN     -- char(n)
        * date
        * float
        * float4
        * float8
        * int
        * json
        * macaddr
        * name
        * oid
        * real
        * serial
        * smallint
        * smallserial
        * text
        * time
        * timestamp
        * timetz
        * uuid
        * varchar
        * varcharN -- varchar(n)
        * xid
        * xml
        * ~        -- ignores all attributes left in a tuple
  -f  Display formatted block content dump along with interpretation
  -h  Display this information
  -i  Display interpreted item details
  -k  Verify block checksums
  -R  Display specific block ranges within the file (Blocks are
      indexed from 0)
        [startblock]: block to start at
        [endblock]: block to end at
      A startblock without an endblock will format the single block
  -s  Force segment size to [segsize]
  -n  Force segment number to [segnumber]
  -S  Force block size to [blocksize]
  -x  Force interpreted formatting of block items as index items
  -y  Force interpreted formatting of block items as heap items

The following options are valid for control files:
  -c  Interpret the file listed as a control file
  -f  Display formatted content dump along with interpretation
  -S  Force block size to [blocksize]

Additional functions:
	-m  Interpret file as pg_filenode.map file and print contents
      (all other options will be ignored)

In most cases it's recommended to use the -i and -f options to get
the most useful dump output.
